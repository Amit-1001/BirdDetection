function [pc, numVectors] = AmitSVM(XTrain, YTrain, XTest, YTest, degree, C, threshold)
% Support Vector Machine
% This function trains a SVM on the training set. The SVM is then used to predict
% the labels of the test set. Also, the count of the alpha that passed the
% condition of threshold <= alpha_i <= C-threshold is returned.
